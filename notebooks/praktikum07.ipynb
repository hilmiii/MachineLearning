Penjelasan Singkat Kode Skrip dimulai dengan mengimpor pustaka utama yang dibutuhkan untuk sains data: pandas untuk manipulasi data, numpy untuk operasi numerik, serta modul sklearn untuk membangun model Decision Tree (DecisionTreeClassifier), membagi data (train_test_split), dan mengevaluasi kinerja model (accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix). Dilanjutkan dengan mengimpor matplotlib.pyplot dan seaborn untuk visualisasi data dan hasil model. Bagian berikutnya melakukan otorisasi untuk mengakses Google Drive menggunakan drive.mount('/content/gdrive'), yang merupakan langkah wajib saat bekerja dengan data yang tersimpan di Drive melalui Colab. Setelah mounting, kode menentukan jalur (path) ke direktori data spesifik di Google Drive. Skrip kemudian mencoba mencetak daftar file di dalam direktori tersebut untuk verifikasi. Akhirnya, data dimasukkan ke dalam DataFrame Pandas dengan membaca file dataset_satelit.csv dari jalur yang ditentukan, dan menampilkan data tersebut (data), menandai kesiapan data untuk tahap pemrosesan dan pelatihan model selanjutnya."],"metadata":{"id":"4NyuVCpXoTUk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8Owj9iGObdFl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762591262902,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Rizky Hilmiawan Anggoro","userId":"16261293692683634390"}},"outputId":"14e86f02-573f-473f-9082-d4c91e3dc98f"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 594 entries, 0 to 593\n","Data columns (total 34 columns):\n"," #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------     --------------  -----  \n"," 0   No         594 non-null    int64  \n"," 1   Longitude  594 non-null    float64\n"," 2   Lattitude  594 non-null    float64\n"," 3   N          594 non-null    float64\n"," 4   P          594 non-null    float64\n"," 5   K          593 non-null    float64\n"," 6   Ca         594 non-null    float64\n"," 7   Mg         594 non-null    object \n"," 8   Fe         594 non-null    float64\n"," 9   Mn         594 non-null    float64\n"," 10  Cu         594 non-null    float64\n"," 11  Zn         594 non-null    float64\n"," 12  B          594 non-null    float64\n"," 13  b12        594 non-null    float64\n"," 14  b11        594 non-null    float64\n"," 15  b9         594 non-null    float64\n"," 16  b8a        594 non-null    float64\n"," 17  b8         594 non-null    float64\n"," 18  b7         594 non-null    float64\n"," 19  b6         594 non-null    float64\n"," 20  b5         594 non-null    float64\n"," 21  b4         594 non-null    float64\n"," 22  b3         594 non-null    float64\n"," 23  b2         594 non-null    float64\n"," 24  b1         594 non-null    float64\n"," 25  Sigma_VV   594 non-null    float64\n"," 26  Sigma_VH   594 non-null    float64\n"," 27  plia       594 non-null    float64\n"," 28  lia        594 non-null    float64\n"," 29  iafe       594 non-null    float64\n"," 30  gamma0_vv  594 non-null    float64\n"," 31  gamma0_vh  594 non-null    float64\n"," 32  beta0_vv   594 non-null    float64\n"," 33  beta0_vh   594 non-null    float64\n","dtypes: float64(32), int64(1), object(1)\n","memory usage: 157.9+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Output dari `data.info()` menunjukkan bahwa *DataFrame* berisi **594 entri** dan **34 kolom**.

inisiasi serta pelatihan model. Tahap pertama berfokus pada perbaikan dua masalah yang teridentifikasi: kolom **`Mg`** dan **`K`**. Untuk kolom `Mg`, karakter non-numerik (tanda kurung tutup `)`) dihapus, dan kolom tersebut dikonversi paksa menjadi tipe data **numerik** (`float`). Setelah itu, **nilai yang hilang** pada kolom **`K`** diatasi dengan teknik **imputasi**, di mana nilai-nilai yang hilang pada kedua *subset* (pelatihan dan pengujian) diisi menggunakan **nilai rata-rata (`mean`)** dari kolom `K` pada data pelatihan. Setelah data dipersiapkan dan dibersihkan, model *Machine Learning* yaitu **Regresi Linier (`LinearRegression`)** diimpor dan diinisiasi, dan kemudian model tersebut **dilatih** (`model.fit`) menggunakan data fitur pelatihan (`X_train`) dan data target pelatihan (`y_train`).

Pertama, skrip **mengambil nilai *Intersep* dan *Koefisien*** dari model. Nilai **Intersep** adalah perkiraan nilai prediksi untuk setiap kolom target 'b' ketika semua fitur input bernilai nol. **Koefisien** dikelompokkan dalam *DataFrame* untuk menunjukkan dampak setiap fitur input terhadap setiap variabel target. Interpretasi koefisien kemudian diberikan, yang menjelaskan bahwa nilai koefisien menunjukkan **perubahan yang diharapkan** pada variabel target untuk setiap **peningkatan satu unit** pada fitur input terkait, dengan asumsi fitur lainnya tetap konstan. Terakhir, skrip mengulangi langkah evaluasi dengan menghitung **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** dan **R-squared ($R^2$)** pada data pengujian untuk mengukur **akurasi dan kecocokan** model secara

yang dipelajari** oleh model Regresi Linier, yang merupakan kunci untuk memahami hubungan antara fitur input dan variabel target. Pertama, nilai **Intersep** (titik potong) dan **Koefisien** (bobot) dari model diambil. Intersep menunjukkan nilai yang diprediksi untuk semua variabel target spektral ('b') ketika semua fitur input unsur hara dan radar bernilai nol. Koefisien, yang disajikan dalam *DataFrame*, adalah metrik utama: setiap nilai koefisien menunjukkan **magnitudo dan arah pengaruh** fitur input terkait terhadap setiap variabel target. Interpretasi disajikan dengan menyoroti **tiga fitur dengan pengaruh terbesar** (koefisien absolut terbesar) untuk setiap variabel target 'b', menjelaskan bahwa **peningkatan satu unit pada fitur tersebut akan menyebabkan perubahan sebesar nilai koefisien** pada variabel target yang diprediksi, dengan asumsi semua fitur lain dipertahankan konstan (*ceteris paribus*).

etadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Kode ini bertujuan untuk **memvisualisasikan kinerja** model Regresi Linier dengan membandingkan nilai aktual dan nilai prediksi dari variabel target terpilih menggunakan **Scatter Plot**. Skrip memilih tiga variabel target, yaitu **`b12`**, **`b8`**, dan **`b1`**, lalu membuat *figure* dengan tiga *subplot* yang berdampingan. Pada setiap *subplot*, titik-titik data diplot di mana sumbu **X** mewakili nilai aktual dari data pengujian (`y_test`) dan sumbu **Y** mewakili nilai yang diprediksi oleh model (`y_pred`). Selain itu, sebuah **garis diagonal putus-putus merah ($y=x$)** diletakkan sebagai referensi ideal; titik-titik yang jatuh **dekat dengan garis ini** menunjukkan bahwa model memprediksi dengan akurat.

Pertama, model digunakan untuk menghasilkan prediksi pada data fitur pengujian (`X_test`), disimpan dalam `y_pred_test`. Selanjutnya, sebuah *DataFrame* baru bernama `hasil` dibuat, yang menyalin fitur-fitur dari `X_test`. Kemudian, melalui sebuah perulangan, kolom-kolom baru ditambahkan ke *DataFrame* `hasil` untuk setiap variabel target ('b'), yang berisi: **Nilai Aktual** (`y_test`), **Nilai Prediksi** (`y_pred_test`), dan yang paling penting, **Persentase Error**. Persentase error ini dihitung sebagai nilai absolut dari perbedaan antara prediksi dan aktual, dibagi dengan nilai aktual (ditambah $\\epsilon$ kecil untuk menghindari pembagian dengan nol), lalu dikalikan 100. *DataFrame* `hasil` akhir kemudian ditampilkan, memungkinkan analisis baris demi baris mengenai seberapa akurat model memprediksi setiap nilai spektral dan persentase kesalahannya."],"metadata":{"id":"mROf8BTdrKKr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import statsmodels.api as sm\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\n","\n","# Add a constant to the feature variables (intercept)\n","X_train_sm = sm.add_constant(X_train)\n","X_test_sm = sm.add_constant(X_test)\n","\n","\n","# Fit the OLS model for each target variable and print the summary\n","for target_col in y_train.columns:\n","    print(f\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\")\n","    print(f\"OLS Regression Results for target variable: {target_col}\")\n","    print(f\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n","    model_sm = sm.OLS(y_train[target_col], X_train_sm).fit()\n","    print(model_sm.summary())\n","\n","# Evaluate the model using MSE and R-squared\n","y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n","\n","mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\n","r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)\n","\n","print(f\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\")\n","print(\"Model Evaluation Metrics:\")\n","print(f\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n","print(f\"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse}\")\n","print(f\"R-squared (R2): {r2}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0iaSs6GRmmIF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762591298940,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":2049,"user":{"displayName":"Rizky Hilmiawan Anggoro","userId":"16261293692683634390"}},"outputId":"3e6f5536-17d8-492b-d8ad-963f955aa108"},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","----------------------------------------------------\n","OLS Regression Results for target variable: b12\n","----------------------------------------------------\n","                            OLS Regression Results                            \n","==============================================================================\n","Dep.

Pertama, ia **menambahkan konstanta** (intercept) ke *DataFrame* fitur pelatihan (`X_train_sm`) dan pengujian (`X_test_sm`), yang merupakan kebutuhan khas untuk model **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**. Selanjutnya, skrip melakukan **Regresi OLS terpisah** untuk **setiap variabel target** spektral ('b') terhadap semua fitur input. Untuk setiap model OLS, ia mencetak **Ringkasan Model** lengkap (`model_sm.summary()`), yang tidak hanya memberikan koefisien dan *R-squared*, tetapi juga statistik inferensial penting seperti nilai-p (p-value) untuk mengidentifikasi fitur mana yang **signifikan secara statistik**. Terakhir, kode mengulang perhitungan **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** dan **R-squared ($R^2$)** menggunakan fungsi dari `sklearn.metrics` untuk memberikan metrik kinerja model secara umum pada data pengujian, melengkapi analisis statistik dengan evaluasi prediktif."],"metadata":{"id":"ST77xCIJrQ-k"}}]}
